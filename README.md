# Udacity Would You Rather? Project
This project represents the React/Redux combined practicising for Udacity's React Nanodegree course.

At this game you should give answers to "Would You Rather" questions and you need to choose from only two options. Answering "neither" or "both" is against the rules.

In this app, users are able to answer questions, see which questions they havenâ€™t answered, see how other people have voted, post questions, and see the ranking of users on the leaderboard.
